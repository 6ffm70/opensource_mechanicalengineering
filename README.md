<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>Q: What information and data is required for community development of mechanical engineering systems?<br>
A: Finding an answer to this question is the subject of this repository. You may want to use the <i>Discussions</i> feature of this repo.</p>
<p>Q: How to edit the file?<br>
A: One choice is <a href="https://github.com/LibreOffice/core">LibreOffice</a> Draw</p>
<p>Q: Why would we need native CAD files when we have STEP 3d files?<br>
A: Native files contain system design parameters that control the development intent for assemblies and systems.
   There are different approaches between different CAD systems; too numerous to list. A good example is <b>top-down design</b>; explained here:        https://youtu.be/ycvaCOCResU</p>
