Description of useful engineering data content for collaborative mechanical engineering

Q: What information and data is required for community development of mechanical engineering systems?

A: Finding an answer to this question is the subject of this repository.

Q: Why would we need native CAD files when we have STEP 3d files?

A: Native files contain system design parameters that control the development intent for assemblies and systems.
   There are different approaches between different CAD systems; too numerous to list. A good example is top-down design explained here: https://youtu.be/ycvaCOCResU
